        <h2>Rizal's Execution and Martyrdom</h2>
        <p>On December 30, 1896, Jose Rizal was executed by firing squad at Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park) in Manila. He was accused of being a revolutionary leader despite his advocacy for reforms rather than outright rebellion. His execution galvanized the Filipino people and became a symbol of resistance against Spanish oppression.</p>
        <p>Rizal's final moments were marked by dignity. He faced his death calmly, and his death became a catalyst for the Philippine Revolution, inspiring countless Filipinos to rise up against colonial rule.</p>
