        <h2>Rizal's Education and Literary Works</h2>
        <p>Rizal was highly educated, studying in Manila and later in Europe. He graduated with a degree in Medicine from the Universidad Central de Madrid and earned a degree in Philosophy and Letters. Throughout his time in Europe, he was inspired to write works that called for reform and justice for Filipinos under Spanish rule.</p>
        <p>Some of his most notable works include the novels *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo*, which exposed the corruption and abuses of the Spanish clergy and government. His writings ignited the flame of revolution among Filipinos and are considered among the most influential works in Philippine literature.</p>
