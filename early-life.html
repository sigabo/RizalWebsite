        <h2>Jose Rizalâ€™s Early Years</h2>
        <p>Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal was the seventh of eleven children in a prosperous family. His parents were Francisco Rizal Mercado, a wealthy farmer, and Teodora Alonso Realonda, a well-educated woman. Rizal exhibited exceptional intellect from a young age, reading and writing in both Spanish and Filipino by the time he was three years old.</p>
        <p>He was a devoted son and was particularly close to his mother, who taught him the values of education and hard work. At the age of eight, he wrote his first poem, "Sa Aking Mga Kabata," which expressed his love for his country and his people.</p>
